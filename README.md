# Note :
<strong>1- Run multiple clients to see how the application can support multiple client at the same time. <br>
2- In the Future module i will be adding a voice message system  to this project(that's why you will see a voice message button in the chat app :P ). </strong>
3- Any feedback is most welcome and appreciated. Just create an issue for the same and i will respond as soon as possible.
